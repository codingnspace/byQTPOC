Like she would hit me and my sisters with baseball bats, bang our heads up against walls, and she would always tell me I was ugly. I remember once she threw out all the food in the fridge, just so we wouldn't have anything to eat.' Due to escalating violence, Banks moved out of her mother's home at age 14 to live with her older sister",

Wilson also recalls being told that they would die spontaneously if they didn't behave correctly. In an interview with The Guardian, Wilson stated: we all lived in the same community, within 10 minutes of each other.
